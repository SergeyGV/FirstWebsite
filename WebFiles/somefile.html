    <h1>Hello universe!</h1>
    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <h3>Hello!</h3>
    <h4>Hello!</h4>

    <p>This is <em>really</em> just sample text to see how HTML does wrapping
    with paragraphs. <strong>I don't know what to write!</strong> I could have taken 
    the harry potter example from the lecture slides I'm learning off
    but I can't copy and paste from it!</p>

    <p><strong>WATCH OUT A <em>CLIFFORD TORUS</em> HAS INFILITRATED THE WEBSITE</strong></p>
    <img src="../Pictures/Clifford-torus.gif" alt="YOU DUG YOUR GRAVE NOW LIE IN IT"/> 

    <p>A list of stuff:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stuff</li>
        <li>Even more stuff</li>
        <li>That's a lot of stuff!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A more clean list of stuff:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Blin</li>
        <li>Kompot</li>
        <li>Vodka</li>
    </ol>

    <table style="width:100%">
        <tr><td>Table</td><td>stuff!</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Cool</td><td>huh?</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p> Quote from a wise man: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Lorem impsum I'm too lazy to head on the website, hey that fit somewhat. I don't know
        why you are quoting me spouting nonsense, get out of here. Really, the text should wrap at
        this point, so stop quoting me dammit!</p>
